# Resources
The resources available for this project include: 
* Videos in the database provided by the Client (Cinefly). 
* Materials in the ANU library and resources provided by the Techlaunch project.
* Open-source algorithms or codes from online communities, such as from Youtube videos, Github.
* Paid services provided by some development platforms, such as AWS and Google.

Costs and Risks: The first three resources are free of charge and have little risks to use. However, paid services from those development platforms will cost money. Even though the client would like to bear the cost, there remains potential risks for our team to integrate our former functions into those APIs. Thus, we need to have a thorough investigation into and comparison with these paid services. Then we can make a suitable choice for the project and finally get a satisfactory product.
