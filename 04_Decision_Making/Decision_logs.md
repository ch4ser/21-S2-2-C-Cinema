|       29/7/2021       |Medium        |Team formalisation                                            |New semester begins, we team need to recruit more members to share the pressure.|     We can have new members and we will have more positive outcomes. The average workload will be much less than what we did in last semester| We may need to spend some time getting familiar with each other |All team members: Jiawei Fan, Yuliang Ma, Yuchen Wang, Xiaoxiang Kong, Cilla, Tao Qu, Jiaye Li|   Successfully completed| None
|       2/8/2021        |Low|Determine the time of first meeting with Kai(client)          |We need to define the goal of the project in this semester.| We can make our timeline and expected outcome based on the answer from our client.| Our client may need to spend some time although he is very busy with his company.| Yuliang Ma sent an invitation and Kai agreed that he would attent the meeting at 15:45 4/8/2021.|Successfully completed| None
|       4/8/2021        |Low        |Preparation for Audit 1                                      |Audit 1 is on 9th August, so we need to distribute each member's working content about that.| We can have fuller content during the audit.| It may take extra time for each member to prepare it. | Every member was arranged to complete corresponding work before 6th August. The ppt will be completed by 8th August.|Successfully completed| None
|       6/8/2021        |Medium|Determine the basic construction and content of group presentation in Audit 1|Audit 1 will be held on 9th August, we need to use a ppt to complete our presentation. The time length of the speech is limited as 15-20mins, we need to consult with each other to fill up it| The construction of our speech will be more reasonable, and the content will be more meaningful. Every fields that the tutors pay attention to will be mentioned and explored. The mark will be promoted. | It may occupy everyone's weekend time.| We decided to follow the guidance published by the official Techlaucher page to complete our presentation. The construction of the speech is: <br/></br><br/>1>Prologue</br><br/>2>Introduction of the project(including client and show of SOW)</br><br/>3>Answer of Project Client Map and statement of stakeholder</br><br/>4>List of constraints and risks</br><br/>5>List of resources and cost</br><br/>6>Member introduction and team charter</br><br/>7>USM and schedule</br><br/>8>End</br>|Most parts are successfully completed.But we did not arrange time to practice to cooperate with each other| We held an emergency meeting to do this.
|       21/8/2021       |Critical|Determine the technical route and arrange work| We got the sample videos from our client, then we need to find method of achieving goals by analyzing the samples. Since the open source function is unstable and it is difficult to integrate several functions to one project, while the service provided by Google and Amazon has obvious advantage.|We can conveniently call the apis from Google AI platform and AWS and combine them to implement our ideas. We can save plenty of time in debugging so we may have more time to construct our database and do more research in CV.|It may produce more expenses if we do not get an AWS account. We may need to ask our client for help.|We decided to use AWS to extract information from the content of keyframes in our videos. Meanwhile, Google's Speech-To-Text will be used to process the voice recognition. The algorithm of combining these outcomes will be developed in the future.|Client did not give us the AWS account on time, and he could not be completely sure that the outcome is what he expected.|One of our member's friend is currently working for Google and he offered us a Google AI platform account; We had contacted with one engineer who is working in Kai's app design team and we confirmed with him for the outputs of functions for many times.
|       26/8/2021       |High|Add new attributes in outcome csv file produced by our algorithm.|Because Jason--the engineer in Kai's team mailed us to provide us some attached video materials which can be used by the algorithm to detect the age and gender, and he also required us to detect exercise, food and occupation as well. Hence, we held a emergency meeting to deal with these new requirements. |It can enrich the functionality of our algorithm| It may take up our Audit 2 preparation time.|We let some of our members undertake more document and show materials of Audit 2 and others focused on the technical aspects to try our best to make out it.| Yuliang(main technical responsible member) decided to fully bury himself to additional technical work and rest of us shared his original work.|Everything went well.
