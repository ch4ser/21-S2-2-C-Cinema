|       29/7/2021       |Medium        |Team formalisation                                            |New semester begins, we team need to recruit more members to share the pressure.|     We can have new members and we will have more positive outcomes. The average workload will be much less than what we did in last semester| We may need to spend some time getting familiar with each other |All team members: Jiawei Fan, Yuliang Ma, Yuchen Wang, Xiaoxiang Kong, Cilla, Tao Qu, Jiaye Li|   Successfully completed| None
|       2/8/2021        |Low|Determine the time of first meeting with Kai(client)          |We need to define the goal of the project in this semester.| We can make our timeline and expected outcome based on the answer from our client.| Our client may need to spend some time although he is very busy with his company.| Yuliang Ma sent an invitation and Kai agreed that he would attent the meeting at 15:45 4/8/2021.|Successfully completed| None
|       4/8/2021        |Low        |Preparation for Audit 1                                      |Audit 1 is on 9th August, so we need to distribute each member's working content about that.| We can have fuller content during the audit.| It may take extra time for each member to prepare it. | Every member was arranged to complete corresponding work before 6th August. The ppt will be completed by 8th August.|Successfully completed| None
|       6/8/2021        |Medium|Determine the basic construction and content of group presentation in Audit 1|Audit 1 will be held on 9th August, we need to use a ppt to complete our presentation. The time length of the speech is limited as 15-20mins, we need to consult with each other to fill up it| The construction of our speech will be more reasonable, and the content will be more meaningful. Every fields that the tutors pay attention to will be mentioned and explored. The mark will be promoted. | It may occupy everyone's weekend time.| We decided to follow the guidance published by the official Techlaucher page to complete our presentation. The construction of the speech is: <br/></br><br/>1>Prologue</br><br/>2>Introduction of the project(including client and show of SOW)</br><br/>3>Answer of Project Client Map and statement of stakeholder</br><br/>4>List of constraints and risks</br><br/>5>List of resources and cost</br><br/>6>Member introduction and team charter</br><br/>7>USM and schedule</br><br/>8>End</br>|Most parts are successfully completed.But we did not arrange time to practice to cooperate with each other| We held an emergency meeting to do this.
|       19/8/2021       |Critical|Determine the technical route and arrange work| We got the sample videos from our client, then we need to find method of achieving goals by analyzing the samples. Since the open source function is unstable and it is difficult to integrate several functions to one project, while the service provided by Google and Amazon has obvious advantage.|We can conveniently call the apis from Google AI platform and AWS and combine them to implement our ideas. We can save plenty of time in debugging so we may have more time to construct our database and do more research in CV.|It may produce more expenses if we do not get an AWS account. We may need to ask our client for help.|We decided to use AWS to extract information from the content of keyframes in our videos. Meanwhile, Google's Speech-To-Text will be used to process the voice recognition. The algorithm of combining these outcomes will be developed in the future.|Client did not give us the AWS account on time, and he could not be completely sure that the outcome is what he expected.|One of our member's friend is currently working for Google and he offered us a Google AI platform account; We had contacted with one engineer who is working in Kai's app design team and we confirmed with him for the outputs of functions for many times.
|       27/8/2021       |High|Add new attributes in outcome csv file produced by our algorithm.|Because Jason--the engineer in Kai's team mailed us to provide us some attached video materials which can be used by the algorithm to detect the age and gender, and he also required us to detect exercise, food and occupation as well. Hence, we held a emergency meeting to deal with these new requirements. |It can enrich the functionality of our algorithm| It may take up our Audit 2 preparation time.|We let some of our members undertake more document and show materials of Audit 2 and others focused on the technical aspects to try our best to make out it.| Yuliang(main technical responsible member) decided to fully bury himself to additional technical work and rest of us shared his original work.|Everything went well.                                           
|       4/9/2021        |Critical|Summarize the feedbacks from Audit 2 and modify our repo based on some of them. |After Audit 2, we received some reviews from our tutors and the shadow team members. Some suggestions are really helpful, and we decided to make use of them.| The content of our repo becomes more standard. |We may need to spend more time to accomplish the technical work.| We arranged a member to entirely take care of the arrangement of tasks in Jira so that it can truly work;We updated our USM and now it can better identify use cases and help us analyze functionality; We add a new cladogram in the decision log folder to show all the options we met in each decision-making process, as well as its existed and probable results.|Everything executed well. |We may consider transfer some members from technical work to document.
|       7/9/2021        |High|Integrate a csv file that contains all the labels(transcript, name, age, gender, food, exercise, occupation) we can detect until now and send it to the client's engineer for further evaluation.| We use the open-source algorithms written in last semester and the model provided by Google Platform and AWS and we are able to produce corresponding detection in our SOW. Although some detections still have problems, we think we should negotiate with the client's engineer team and show them what we discovered.|We can get their feedback and evaluations as soon as possible, as well as their guidance. We can plan our future work based on that.| It may expose some technical issues to our client.| We wrote an email to let the engineers see our outcomes, and we admitted that there were still some fields(like food and occupation) to be fixed. They affirmed our work and came up with more requirements as well.| Well|None.
|       18/9/2021       |Medium|Manually supplement more categories of labels in our training set to get better performance.| The accuracy of the detection of food and occupation is unsatisfactory.| We may construct high-performance model.| We may waste our time.|All of us decided to do that.|We did that, and the performance became better. We found more labels based on the result of searching and relative knowledge. Now, the model can find more labels including ones that are not clearly mentioned.| None.
|       22/9/2021       |Critical|Negotiate with client's team to declare that some bonus tasks can not be completed on time.|Because it brought so much extra workload that it affected our progress of completing tasks listed on SOW.| It expresses our plight to both our client and our tutor. It makes our client realize that the scope of our project should be basically under control. If we are always busy with urgent tasks, we will not deliver the items on the SOW. We will not meet the requirements.| Absolutely, it may make our client and his engineering team unhappy. Because the rejection of their orders means that they need to solve some technical issues in person.| We had meetings with our client and his engineering team, we also reported the outcome of this meeting to our tutors.We will manage to generate an acceptable scheme during this meeting.|The final conclusion is that if the client insists on letting us do this bonus work, he also needs to agree to the change of SOW. Finally, they asked us to follow the initial SOW without firstly focusing on their urgent tasks.| We may ask all the members to do technical work without maintaining our document repo.
|       28/9/2021       |High|Decide to use other types of techniques to improve the performance, especially the description of the content of a video.| Since the Google api--Speech-to-text and AWS are benchmarks in relative industry fields, we do not think we can improve their performance with the limit of current training material. Hence, we need to find other techniques that can help us dig out more information contained by the videos.|It may boost our model.|It may take us much time but bring no benefits.|We decided to spend about 3 days in trying other techniques. Once 3 days passed, we need to focus on the preparation of Audit 3.|We used cv technique to extract graphical information in the training material and integrated it to one csv file. We found that the information provided by the videos where people is doing what they are talking about helps much when other components of our model attempt to understand the sentences.|We would abandon it if we can not make any progress after 3 days.
|       5/10/2021       |High|Stop technical development and reorganize our codes.| There is only a week before our last Audit, we need all our members to take care of it. Besides, the code needs to be cleaned up so that it is friendly to our users.|Our project will end up reasonably.| We may lose chance of modifying our algorithms.| The functions in the demo code should be treated as independent parts before our user call it by some specific methods. The user should get a explicit entrance and use that to  |All the functions are packaged and the entrance of our programme is clearly noted. The arrangement of Audit 3 is also confirmed by every member| None.
