The average workload will be much less than what we did in last semester| We may need to spend some time getting familiar with each other |All team members: Jiawei Fan, Yuliang Ma, Yuchen Wang, Xiaoxiang Kong, Cilla, Tao Qu, Jiaye Li|

|       2/8/2021        |Communication|Determine the time of first meeting with Kai(client)          |We need to define the goal of the project in this semester.| We can make our timeline and expected outcome based on the answer from our client.| Our client may need to spend some time although he is very busy with his company.| Yuliang Ma sent an invitation and Kai agreed that he would attent the meeting at 15:45 4/8/2021.|
|       4/8/2021        |Technology   |Main technical aspects and expected outcomes are confirmed by our client        | Kai attended the client meeting and patiently answered all the questions from us.|  We can study relative knowledge and practice the regarding skills in advance. We can distribute the work based on its content and each member's capacity and experience | The expectation and guidance given by the client may still be general. Hence we team still need to decide the technical route. The final outcome may be a bit different from the client's expectation.| This semester, we need to extract the demographic, psychographic and behavioural information from the story-board format video uploaded by the user. To achieve this, we need to focus on NLP firstly(AWS was recommended by the client), then we need to consider using computer vision to get other information. The bonus options are activity identification and database. We can attempt to design these parts if our NLP and CV model is good enough.

The ppt will be completed by 8th August.|
